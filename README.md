# Search With DuckDuckGo - Chrome extension

## Keep your search private and secure.

### How to use
Select any text and right-click on the selection. You'll see the "Search with DuckDuckGo" option in the context menu, which when clicked, opens DuckDuckGo search results in a new tab.

### Why to use:
Search engines are the gate-keepers to the internet, it's important to choose the one that will respect your privacy and provide uncensored and unfiltered search results. Other search engines don't provide the same privacy and security benefits of DuckDuckGo.

DuckDuckGo's business model is the greatest advantage over other search engines. DuckDuckGo doesn’t have a filter bubble. Its search results are derived from over 400 sources, that include big search engines like Bing or Yahoo, but also DuckDuckGo’s own web crawlers. Its organic results aren’t intervened by personalized filters, because DuckDuckGo doesn’t maintain a personal profile on you like other search engines do. 

Give it a try now and see the advantages for yourself.
